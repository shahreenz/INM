<div class="content">
  <p>Our test team have highlighted the following issues with the app:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The date pickers on the booking form allow dates to be chosen in the
      future
    </li>
    <li>
      The form validation on the booking form should trigger for any invalid
      controls upon clicking submit
    </li>
    <li>Text inputs on the booking form allow numeric input</li>
    <li>
      The arrival time control on the booking form allows non-times to be added,
      which results in errors on the inmates list
    </li>
    <li>The Reference column on the inmates list is not being populated</li>
    <li>
      The Paginator and Sort are not working on the inmates list. Perhaps they
      have been set up incorrectly?
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Please try to fix as many of the listed issues as you can. Feel free to
    refer to any docs or investigate the solution as you would if you were in a
    normal dev environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The test team have also noted that the original developer hasn't written any
    unit tests for their code. If you would like to add any test coverage,
    please do.
